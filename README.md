AS an employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to schedule events on a daily planner
TO effectively manage my time

WHEN the daily planner opens
THEN I want to see the current date and time at the top of the planner
WHEN I click on a time slot
THEN I am able to write my event into the text
WHEN I am finished creating an entry by hour or half hour
THEN I am able to save the event
WHEN the page is refreshed
THEN the information available in the text field is saved
